# MerossToInfluxDB
Docker Container to gather stats from Meross cloud and send it to influxdb instance.

This is based on the work done by https://github.com/albertogeniola

I needed something simple to poll Meross devices and get the stats in InfluxDB. This is my very first attempt at dockerizing something so any feedback is welcome.
